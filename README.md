Creating a Python chatbot utilizing PyTorch


This is a project following the tutorial from Patrick Loeber's YouTube series "Chat Bot With PyTorch - NLP And Deep Learning - Python Tutorial" in four parts.


The simple chatbot executes a few different steps to create the call and response. 

1. Intents and tags
2. NLTK input parsing (i.e tokenizing, stemming and creating bag of words)
3. Creating the model utilizing Neural Networks and hidden layers
4. Training the model using intents and input parsing
5. Creating the call and response chatbot activating the model utilizing direct input


This code is basically a copy of the tutorial with plans to implement improvements for different use cases in the future and to dive deeper in understanding of the model process itself.
